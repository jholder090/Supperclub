## A web application for connecting foodies with local chefs

### This was an amazingly fun project to work on. Map and geocoding APIs formed the centerpieces for this app. I'm especially proud of how seamlessly the UI for map searching worked out.

#### My contributions:
+ Search bar logic with incorporated geocoding API integration and connected map filtering.
+ User dashboard styling and data retrieval.
+ Responsive navbar

#### Technologies:
+ PERN stack
+ Redux Toolkit
+ Sequelize
+ Mapbox/Cloudinary/Stripe APIs
+ Material UI component styling
